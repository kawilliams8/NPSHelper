# NPS Helper

NPS Helper is the final solo project built during Module 3 of the Front End Engineering program at the Turing School of Software & Design. Over the course of five days, I designed, built and tested a React/Redux web app that displays data received data from three API's of choice.

The National Parks Service API provides information on numerous parks, monuments and other historical sites across the United States. With each location's provided latitude and longitude, I was able to search the Trail Run Project's API and provide hiking/running trails within a ten mile radius of each Park. The mapbox API provides an additional area map based on the latitude and longitude of the Park.

This project was built with the create-react-app starter kit. All tests are executed by Jest and Enzyme, focused on changes to state, React Router, ASYNC functionality, propTypes and JSX snapshots. NPS Helper builds on my experiences with Object Oriented Programming, Test Driven Development, and Single Responsibility principles.

NPS Helper receives a Lighthouse Best Practices audit score of 86.

This project uses the [National Park Typeface](https://nationalparktypeface.com/).
